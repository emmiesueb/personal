                        <h3>Pumpkin Tracker | <a href="https://spirits.flutr.org/" target="blank">URL</a></h3>
                        <p> Every year, Reiman Gardens hosts a Spirit of the Gardens event in October, where 1200+ pumpkins are carved and displayed 
                            for each week of the event. Volunteers are requested to help cut out stencils, trace stencils onto pumpkins, and carve them.                            
                            All pumpkin statuses are stored in a single excel sheet, where Admins must manually adjust the statuses of each stencil&mdash;whether
                            they've been printed, cut out, traced, or carved. Volunteers will take stencils and pumpkins each week to trace the cut out stencils
                            and/or carve the traced pumpkins, which that information needs to be sent to the Event Admins so they know what stencils are left that
                            need to be completed. Additionally, Event Admins for Spirits of the Gardens will select stencils to be used for each week of the event, 
                            which means that week or those weeks will be when the pumpkin with that stencil is displayed. As the stencil database keeps growing, 
                            this process is becoming increasingly time-consuming due to searching through a single excel sheet.
                            <br> <br>
                            To aid with this issue, my team is currently working with Nathan Brockman&mdash;one of the faculty members at Reiman Gardens&mdash;to develop an 
                            app called "Pumpkin Tracker" to make tracking event information quick, accurate, and easy. Pumpkin Tracker facilitates the various
                            interactions with the stencil database by allowing Event Admins to easily add, delete, update, and archive stencils with the simple 
                            click of a few buttons or input from a barcode scanner as opposed to manually editing a row in an excel sheet that contains 1600+ entries.
                            On the Admin side, there are pages for Login, Event Management, Stencil Selection, and Stencil Management. The Volunteer side was designed
                            to assist in informing the Event Admins of the tracing and carving statuses of the stencils for each week. 
                            <br> <br>
                            I am primarily working on Frontend for the development of the Mobile and Web Application, which is being set up as a 
                            React app. This involves working extensively with ReactDOM, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. Our database is being hosted on a DigitalOcean
                            droplet we deemed appropriate for our applications needs, with the engine running on SQLite. Our team adopted an Agile project development 
                            style since we need to present each design iteration to our client, Nathan Brockman, to receive feedback on user satisfaction and conduct 
                            continuous software testing as we integrate new features.
                            <br>

                            </div>
                            The Volunteer side is the landing page for the application. At the event, Event Volunteers are provided a QR code that will automatically
                            take them to the Stencil Input page of the Volunteer side. Event Volunteers will take the stencil ID provided on the stencil they chose,
                            input it into the text box, and be taken to a Confirmation page where they will either Confirm that is the stencil they have or go back
                            to correct the stencil ID. The next step will be selecting whether the 
                            <br> <br>
                            An Admin Login page was implemented to prevent any malicious actors from gaining access to the stencil database and
                            manipulating the data. A password that is only provided to the Event Admins must be inputted to gain any access to the features provided
                            by the Pumpking Tracker's Admin side. Once verified, Admin users will be taken to the Stencil Selection page.
                            <br> <br>
                            <div style="text-align: center;">

                                <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Stencil Selection page for Pumpkin Tracker</p>
                            </div>
                            The Stencil Selection page will visualize the stencil data from the stencil database and provides both search functionality by ID or name and filtering
                            functionality by week selected and/or category. Event Admins can also add, delete, and update categories or stencils via the Stencil Selection page. 
                            A batch update option known as Quick Select is available, where a stencil can be selected or unselected for the designated week by either typing the stencil 
                            ID or scanning a barcode of the stencil ID. 
                            <br> <br>

                            </div>
                            Event Admins can also navigate to the Event Management page to edit the current event, which can be set for 1-3 
                            weeks. An event can be cancelled or ended upon completion, which ending the event will save data collected for future calculations. Events are used
                            by determining what weeks a stencil can be selected for if it is not archived.
                            <br> <br>
                            <div style="text-align: center;">

                            </div>
                            The Stencil Management page on the Admin side visualizes stencil week data&mdash;this data includes printed, cut, traced, and carved statuses
                            for each week a stencil has been selected. Each step status is valued 0-3, with each status value meaning Not Started (0), In Progress (1), Completed 
                            but not Confirmed (2), and Completed and Confirmed (3). Stencil Management also offers search functionality by ID or name and filtering functionality by
                            week selected, step status, or a specific step. A progress bar also indicates how many stencils out of the total stencils selected have been 
                            completed depending on the step and week the data is being filtered by. A batch update option called Quick Update was implemented to allow
                            Event Admins to, similar to the Quick Select function, where stencil week statuses can be updated after manually typing in an ID or scanning
                            a barcode containing the stencil ID.

                        <p> This class project is dedicated to understanding memory management and other advanced coding techniques in C/C++ while
                            creating a roguelite version of Pok&eacute;mon. Functionalities like dynamic GUI, NPC AI, map 
                            generation, map traversal, and battle mechanics were required as a baseline for developing a roguelite with the 
                            freedom to add additional features. As an avid Pok&eacute;mon fan since Gen 4, I programmed this with attempts to
                            remain faithful to the mechanics of the original Pok&eacute;mon games.
                            <br> <br>
                            Dynamic memory management was vital to this project, especially considering the full map grid would be comprised of a total of 400
                            randomly generated maps and at least 7 randomly generated NPCs per map, each having 3 random pok&eacute;mon in their party. Maps would
                            only be generated upon the PC encountering them, which they would be stored in a world data grid for potential use later use or get free'd 
                            once the program is terminated. Instead of printing out each map to the terminal, the ncurses library in C/C++ was included to provide a
                            dynamically changing GUI for the player. 
                            <br> <br>
                            The game is set on a turn loop, with the PC having the highest priority; all NPCs are waiting
                            for the PC to complete their turn before taking theirs. NPC's turn decisions are dependent on their behavior (friendly, neutral, or 
                            aggressive) toward the PC and, if aggressive, will determine their next move based on the move costs calculated by an implementation of
                            dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding to the PC. If the PC gets ensnared into a wild or trainer battle, the battle UI window will be
                            displayed, allowing the PC to either use an item, fight with the current pok&eacute;mon's moves, switch out with one of their 
                            party pok&eacute;mon, or run (if it's a wild battle). Data for items, pok&eacute;mon species, movesets, moves, types, statuses, etc. had to be 
                            parsed from CSV files provided in a database accessible in the Pyrite server, which get loaded up at runtime prior to  generating the 
                            first map of the game.
                            <br> <br>
                            By using these techniques and combining these features, I created a functional roguelite version of Pok&eacute;mon playable in an 80x24 terminal.
                            Additional functionalities that weren't required but I still implemented include type matchups, solo and party leveling, shiny chances, and 
                            the Pok&eacute;mon Storage System.

                         <p> Patient data confidentiality and management has high priority in all healthcare service environments. With the growth of
                             technology and increasing risks in cyber security, confidentiality has become a large area of concern. Healthcare providers
                             also desire software solutions for managing and booking appointments, reading and writing to patient data, and providing their
                             availability to their patients.

                             I worked with a group of other students to design a Mobile app we named CyHealth to resolve this issue. I was one of 2 members
                             delegated to the Frontend, where we developed views for Patients, Receptionists, Doctors/Nurses, and Admins. We evaluated user profiles
                             and the privileges they needed, which boiled down to: Doctors/Nurses having access to all patient data (diagnoses, prescriptions, etc.), 
                             their own availability and scheduled appointments with patients, and any appointment requests; Receptionists having access to Patient 
                             appointment requests and bookings as well as availabilities of all Doctors/Nurses; Patients having access to their personal data, appointment
                             requests and bookings, and test results; and Admins having access to privileges of workers (Doctors/Nurses and Receptionists).

                             We developed XML files and Java script files in Android Studio for the Frontend and Maven Projects with IntelliJ for the Backend. To
                             enable client-server communication, we utilized REST API through HTTP requests and established Websockets throughout the app, which 
                             Websockets were set in places where it was appropriate to receive real-time updates (i.e., Patient appointment request notifications
                             sent to Receptionist views).

                    <p> I have been working as a Region 4 Customer Support Representative for John Deere under Kelly Services since June 2025. I assist with product management, 
                        licensing, machine data, and troubleshooting user technical issues. I also document cases for customers and dealers as issues arise and handle cases promptly and
                        accurately utilizing a variety of resources like Help Documentation, documented solutions for common or similar issues, and personal knowledge.
                        Frequent collaboration with my colleagues on the Global Support Center team is necessary for notifying the team of system-wide issues and pinpointing solutions
                        for uncommon and complex cases or questions.

                        I have worked in the Iowa State Music Department's Recording Studio as an Engineer since January 2024, where I've had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience 
                        with live mixing concerts and recitals in Pro Tools Studio, troubleshooting Audo/Visual technologies, video recording with an ATEM device, webcasting through
                        Livestream Studio, and editing audio files during post-production. As a Recording Engineer, I also ensure quality control over audio and video
                        recordings.
